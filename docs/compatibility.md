# Compatibility evidence — source-qualified bundle

**Status: source/data checks pass; changed VS Code suggestion and word-diff states have settings-separated renderer evidence and WezTerm's native scheme has config-separated runtime evidence. Overall cross-surface app acceptance remains incomplete.** The qualification previews did not themselves activate normal-profile theme selections; subsequent deployments are separate operations. VS Code opened existing app-global shared storage; fingerprints protect only their specifically measured files, not the entire profile or shared database. This is not a production-readiness claim. Consult GitHub Actions for results on the exact commit; local success does not establish remote CI success. Publication of theme artifacts does not close the remaining runtime gates.

## Pinned comparison targets

- Pinned stable source: Hermes `v0.21.6`, commit `818c13be1dc4fd28987e1e881a9408224afd4535`.
- Main source snapshot: `4eba3ebed1513d1efe45802f396a11679fff02cf` (an observation, not a claim about future main).
- VS Code tested: `1.136.2`; manifest baseline `^1.136.2`.
- Windows Terminal discovered: packaged `1.24.12741.0`; no isolated runtime acceptance.
- Additional isolation-source inspection: `a62979dc3601c9eae455bff5b35ba8f9bed0df30`, a distinct target from the earlier main snapshot.
- Nerd Fonts installer target: `v3.5.1`; unchanged optional installer already targets it. No fonts were installed.
- Current native consumer source: Hermes `71d34bad1045610252eda02ee79549436896e784`; relevant skin, dashboard-normalizer, TUI and desktop converter files are unchanged from this commit. The surrounding checkout has unrelated modifications and was not launched as a stock app.
- WezTerm tested: `20240203-110809-5046fc22`, using a separate config and `--always-new-process --no-auto-connect`.
- Zellij schema target: [v0.45.1 modern role example](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/blob/v0.45.1/zellij-utils/assets/themes/nightfox.kdl). No native Zellij executable was available.

Source contracts were read from these pinned public references without modifying the installed Hermes checkout. The isolation check evaluated only committed pure path-resolution functions, not application bootstrap or services. The candidate defines all **44** current shared skin color tokens, with no missing/extra entries, and covers the stable Python skin engine's built-in color-key union. This is **source-contract evidence**, not runtime acceptance.

## Per-surface matrix

| Surface | Repository / source evidence | Runtime status and exact missing gate |
|---|---|---|
| Classic CLI | Strict skin parsing, explicit aliases, semantic-role/color checks; actual Rich 14.3.3 markup renders both art variants to the source; native current Python loader/config builder preserved all 44 authored colors and banner fields | **App runtime unverified**: clean approved stock launcher, isolated home, real TTY widths 40/80/120, startup, status/diff/completion fixtures and switch-back captures |
| Ink TUI | Shared-token coverage; the actual current `fromSkin` converter ran on the candidate, preserving native text/tool/status/banner expectations and readable body contrast; active art remains one span per source row | **App runtime unverified**: clean stock build plus isolated TTY, cold start/restart, hover/focus/diff/tool/reasoning states and switch-back. Historical renderer reports [#129481](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/issues/129481) / [#46773](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/issues/46773) have independently changing live status; alternate art not activated |
| Dashboard | Separate YAML, strict duplicate-key parsing, mapped hex colors and explicit transparent-glow/layout assertions. The current native pure normalizer ran and retained all authored palette/typography/layout/override fields without importing the server | **App runtime unverified**: real isolated `/api/dashboard/themes` roundtrip, picker selection, computed styles, cards/forms/table/code/diff states and rollback. Do not repeat the earlier dropped-fields concern as a confirmed blocker for these snapshots |
| Desktop | The actual current `skinToDesktopTheme` converter ran, preserving background/foreground/border, both palette slots, and AA sidebar-accent contrast; candidate has every shared color token | **App runtime unverified**: approved clean desktop artifact and proven user-data/home separation from the live instance, JSON-RPC skin readback, startup/controls/state captures and switch-back |
| Windows Terminal | Both distinct scheme names and all schema fields/16 ANSI colors verified as data; legacy scheme hash unchanged | **Unverified**: isolated settings/profile context, actual ANSI/truecolor/glyph/selection/cursor display and profile readback |
| VS Code | Two exact label-to-file contributions, matching workbench exports, complete ANSI colors and immutable legacy files | **Partially verified**: exact maps/token rules, switching/cold restart, all authored CSS variables, hover, editor selection, normal folder-mode status bar and earlier diff/ANSI captures. Terminal text selection, a genuinely disabled menu state, and comprehensive effective-state/accessibility coverage remain incomplete |
| WezTerm | Native TOML, palette-mapped text/cursor/selection/ANSI16/tab states, strict TOML and declared-structure checks | **Partially verified**: actual `load_scheme`, config/scheme resolution, isolated GUI, visible ANSI swatches and all 16 exact authored RGB values in the swatch-region capture. Selection, every tab state, glyph/font and restart behavior remain unverified |
| Zellij | Standalone modern-role KDL with 14 role blocks, ten player colors, complete palette mappings, and a fail-closed nested-block/RGB subset reader | **Native runtime unverified**: real v0.45.1 parser/loading, session/UI states and selection/rollback. This reader is not a general KDL parser or a substitute for Zellij |

## Executed local gates

On Windows with Python **3.11.15**, PyYAML **6.0.3**, Rich **14.3.3**, Ruff **0.15.10** and contained ShellCheck **0.11.0**:

- Ruff lint and formatting checks pass.
- Full repository unit suite passes; exact current count and command outputs are recorded in the final local receipt. Tests include data mutation, strict parsing, legacy hashes, source art/geometry, contrast, provenance, both selector identities, and guarded font fixtures.
- Validator passes as both direct script and package entry point.
- `bash -n`, ShellCheck with `--norc` and all severities, and Git whitespace checks pass. ShellCheck returned zero diagnostics.
- Seven LF-normalized legacy hashes pass. The optional font installer itself is unchanged.
- CI workflow is parsed/contract-tested and action commit references resolve. Linux Python 3.11 and Windows Python 3.14 lanes are configured; consult their actual commit-linked results rather than inferring remote success from configuration or local execution.

## Remaining app-runtime gates

ShellCheck's earlier missing-tool blocker is resolved. The contained binary ran successfully without changing shared PATH or Python environments. No linter requirement was weakened or skipped.

The inspected Hermes checkout has unrelated modifications and is not proof of a stock build. It was neither reset nor patched. The pinned stable `hermes_constants.py:get_default_hermes_root()` can resolve a nested test `HERMES_HOME` back to the live machine-wide root; read-only evaluation reproduced this collision. No CLI/TUI/dashboard/desktop application launch was attempted under that unsafe isolation assumption. The new native consumer checks call only skin loading/building and pure normalizer/converter functions, not full bootstrap, a backend or a scheduler. Build directories in a modified installation are not clean artifact provenance. Do not spoof roots, weaken guards, patch Hermes or attach to a live backend to obtain a pass.

Stage B was entered for settings-separated VS Code, not proven whole-profile isolation. Windows Terminal remains untested: only a packaged installation was established, with no qualified separate portable settings context in the scoped inventory. A new live tab/window/profile is not sufficient isolation. Missing evidence is not proof of a theme defect.

The private readiness packet in `.hermes/evidence/` records the concrete local discovery. Before future runtime work, record exact launch/stop commands, stock provenance, separate home/user-data paths, fixture invocations and rollback. Do not guess flags, reuse the live profile, patch Hermes, or automatically restart failed reviewer jobs.

## VS Code observations and corrections

Runtime observations apply to theme revision `4529f3165234f16c8e1fb36f5ee09c1faa9fe63c`. Through committed review head `4fc24502191c1aac91289902c875dff59ae756d2`, subsequent changes hardened JSON parsing and updated documentation/tests; palettes, exports, artwork and legacy files remained byte-identical to that revision. The local selected-state follow-up below changes the upgrade VS Code exports and their mappings; historical runtime equality does not qualify those new bytes.

- Two contexts were used: an Extension Development Host and a normal window with a passive extension copied into a private extension directory. Historical fingerprints established preservation only for the specifically measured files; they did not establish that the entire normal user profile was untouched. The later normal-window logs show existing shared storage was opened, with no captured before-image to establish its integrity. This is not VSIX or Marketplace acceptance.
- Tokencat's **84** authored colors and token rules matched cached runtime data exactly, as did Carbonfox (Legacy)'s **50** colors and token rules. Switching left no residual Tokencat map entries in legacy. All 84 authored Tokencat CSS-variable values matched before and after cold restart.
- A built-in JSON-setting hover was captured with foreground `rgb(242, 244, 248)` and background `rgb(40, 40, 40)`. This may use default roles rather than authored hover overrides. Editor selection was captured and computed as `rgb(42, 42, 42)`, matching `#2a2a2a`.
- Normal folder-mode status bar computed as background `#0d0d0d`, foreground `#dfdfe0`, including after restart. A later folder-mode screenshot attempt did not complete; this is computed-style evidence.
- A normal no-folder window used fallback `statusBar.noFolderBackground` `#68217a`. The earlier blanket attribution of purple status bars to development-host debugging was not established. No override was added to hide this distinction.
- Earlier captures show diffs, search/menu states and ANSI16. All 16 authored ANSI RGB values were found in the terminal screenshot. The owner approved those seven captures; later hover/selection captures have not received separate visual approval. Neither establishes complete accessibility.
- Terminal-selection input timed out, and subsequent capture transport failed. No genuinely disabled menu entry was established. Neither state is counted as passed; exact CSS-variable equality does not prove every effective component or canvas state.
- Both normal-window process trees and the inspection listener were closed. Fingerprints confirmed approved historical captures and the specifically measured settings/skin files unchanged; this is not a blanket claim about unrelated state, the whole profile or shared storage. Raw profiles/screenshots/process details/machine paths remain private.

**Corrections:** earlier missing-ShellCheck and no-Stage-B statements were stale; isolated VS Code now has partial runtime evidence. Other-surface gates remain open. At committed review head `4fc24502191c1aac91289902c875dff59ae756d2`, strict JSON also rejected exponent overflow to infinity, not just nonstandard `NaN`/`Infinity` constants; theme colors had not changed at that head.

## Selected-state follow-up — settings-separated VS Code verified

At the selected-state follow-up, both upgrade VS Code exports authored **86** workbench colors: the prior 84 plus `editorSuggestWidget.selectedForeground` (`#f2f4f8`) and `editorSuggestWidget.focusHighlightForeground` (`#3ddbd9`). The current word-diff successor authors **87**, adding `diffEditor.insertedTextBorder`. Existing blue unfocused matches and the selected background (`#525253`) are unchanged. Palette mappings use existing base tokens. That VS-only follow-up left base values, legacy files, Hermes skins and Windows Terminal schemes unchanged; the separate CLI metadata readability fix below changes one upgrade skin background.

The source review's blue-on-selected-background calculation (3.31:1) was not proof of an effective focused-match defect: VS Code uses a distinct focused-match role. The follow-up makes that previously inherited state explicit and tests selected text and matches in both exports. Authored selected-text contrast is 7.09:1 and focused-match contrast is 4.58:1; source-level tests do not establish actual rendered acceptance.

Historical 84-color runtime captures above remain evidence only for their pinned revision. Fresh normal-window checks used task-owned user-data and extension directories containing only the passive theme extension, with sync/updates/AI features off. Native logs nevertheless show existing app-global shared storage was opened; no before-image exists, so unchanged shared storage or whole-profile isolation cannot be asserted. The specifically fingerprinted settings/skin files still matched their baselines. Disabling every extension also disables this theme; that initial default-theme window was discarded, not counted as TokenCat evidence.

The real word-suggestion popup showed teal `alp` matches on the focused gray `alphaColor` row and blue matches on unfocused `alphaCommit`/`alphaCompletion` rows. All labels were readable and unclipped. Computed focused background/text/match values were `rgb(82, 82, 83)`, `rgb(242, 244, 248)` and `rgb(61, 219, 217)`; unfocused match text was `rgb(120, 169, 255)`. All 86 authored CSS values matched before and after an actual process-tree stop/relaunch. Switching through Carbonfox (Legacy) reset the focused-match role to the host default, then restored the TokenCat values; legacy transparent hex colors were compared after native CSS normalization.

These observations qualify the changed suggestion states, switching and restart, not every VS Code state, whole-profile isolation or Marketplace packaging. Raw profiles, captures and local receipts remain outside the distributable payload.

## Independent-review fixes — historical qualification

- The CLI consumer's selected metadata style uses `ui_label`, not the main selected label's foreground. Only `completion_menu_meta_current_bg` changed from `border` to existing `surface_selected` (`#2a2a2a`), increasing cyan metadata contrast from 3.30:1 to 6.07:1. The emitted-role guard and the actual native pure style-generation function both reproduced the failure before the fix and pass afterward. This is not a new rendered CLI acceptance claim.
- Public preservation claims are narrowed to measured files and now disclose the shared-storage limitation above. No private database path or log is published.
- RGB nodes in the bounded KDL reader now require ASCII `[0-9]` digits. Arabic-Indic, Devanagari, full-width and mixed decimal tokens reproduced the rejection gap before the fix and are now rejected. The emitted KDL is unchanged; this is not native Zellij parser acceptance.
- Companion regressions calculate contrast for WezTerm body, cursor, selection and every authored tab state, plus Zellij base/emphasis foregrounds against their respective declared role backgrounds. In-memory low-contrast mutations demonstrate each checked foreground guard rejects its counterexample; these calculations do not establish effective rendered app states.
- Source checks and artifact fingerprints were retained in a local evidence manifest. Earlier receipts remain historical rather than being rewritten as proof for changed bytes. These fixes received independent review before the original bundle was merged through PR #2; they are not awaiting their first review.
- A later comparison detected that one previously fingerprinted configuration file had changed since the older baseline. Its current theme selection remained the legacy skin and installed skin fingerprints still matched. The change's cause was not established or reversed; earlier matching measurements are historical evidence, not an ongoing whole-profile preservation guarantee.

## Word-diff successor — reviewed source and bounded native rendering

Commit `8243921b7af72d50c322f37e1be444602d5cc4f2` darkens only the VS Code word fills to `#1a3525` (inserted) and `#462535` (removed), retaining syntax comment `#97999b`, and adds opaque inserted-word border `#25be6a`. Both theme and customization exports have identical roles. All explicitly emitted syntax foregrounds clear 4.5:1 on both word fills; four old-background mutations exercise both exports and fail the regression guard. Border contrast clears 3:1 against word and line backgrounds.

Dedicated VS Code diff editors rendered syntax-colored comments with measured contrast **4.6495:1** and **4.6596:1**, including a cold-start theme and standalone customizations over Carbonfox (Legacy). The inserted-word border was visible with nonzero computed width; display scaling makes an exact one-CSS-pixel assertion inappropriate. Fourteen measured protected files matched their baseline afterward. This is bounded word-diff evidence, not whole-profile/shared-storage preservation or full accessibility coverage; raw captures remain private.

Independent review of the seven-file fix passed without security or logic concerns. The full local suite passed **81 tests**, including the actual native Hermes style-generator integration, plus both validators, Ruff lint/format, shell syntax, ShellCheck and whitespace checks. Exact-commit GitHub Actions runs for `8243921` and README follow-up `c9f7e1a` passed on Linux/Python 3.11 and Windows/Python 3.14. Hosted CI explicitly skips the optional native Hermes integration when no source tree is supplied; its local pass is separate evidence. This does not assert that the normal installed VS Code package was updated. Later documentation changes require their own exact-commit checks.

## Rollback

Carbonfox files remain unchanged and separately selectable. Hermes: keep both skins and choose `carbonfox` (or restore the user's recorded prior skin). Windows Terminal: choose the retained `carbonfox` scheme only for the intended profile. VS Code: choose **Carbonfox (Legacy)**, restoring any explicitly merged customization keys first. Dashboard: restore the exact previous dashboard choice; no legacy dashboard variant exists. No live theme-selection rollback was performed. The other measured locations matched their recorded baseline states at the latest comparison. Hermes configuration differs from its historical fingerprint; its cause is unestablished and it was not restored. Shared-storage preservation remains unverified.
