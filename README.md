# Tokencat

A Carbonfox-derived dark theme for Hermes and companion apps, with an unchanged **Carbonfox (Legacy)** variant for switching back. The repository remains `chrisluersen/hermesfox-theme`; `tokencat-theme` is a proposed future name, not a completed rename or a publication claim.

This is a source-qualified theme bundle, not a claim of complete app/runtime acceptance. VS Code suggestion states were verified visually and by computed styles through switching and cold restart; WezTerm loaded and displayed the new native scheme. Native Hermes skin/normalizer/converter checks pass, while full CLI/TUI/dashboard/desktop, Windows Terminal and Zellij app acceptance remain outstanding. See [the per-surface evidence matrix](docs/compatibility.md), [palette lineage](docs/palette.md), [validation](docs/validation.md), and [rights/attribution](NOTICE.md).

## Shipped variants

| Surface | Upgraded Tokencat | Preserved Carbonfox |
|---|---|---|
| Palette | `palettes/tokencat.json` | `palette.json` |
| Hermes CLI / TUI / desktop skin | `hermes/skins/tokencat.yaml`, name `tokencat` | `hermes/skins/carbonfox.yaml`, name `carbonfox` |
| Dashboard | `hermes/dashboard-themes/tokencat.yaml` | No previous dashboard export existed |
| Windows Terminal | `windows-terminal/tokencat.scheme.json`, name `tokencat` | `windows-terminal/scheme.json`, name `carbonfox` |
| VS Code theme | `vscode/tokencat.vscode-theme.json`, label **Tokencat** | `vscode/carbonfox.vscode-theme.json`, label **Carbonfox (Legacy)** |
| VS Code merge fragment | `vscode/tokencat-color-customizations.json` | `vscode/vscode-color-customizations.json` |
| WezTerm | `wezterm/tokencat.toml`, scheme **Tokencat** | No legacy companion export existed; preserve the user's prior choice |
| Zellij | `zellij/tokencat.kdl`, theme `tokencat` | No legacy companion export existed; preserve the user's prior choice |

`vscode/package.json` contributes both themes in one minimal, code-free local extension. Its declared baseline is VS Code `^1.136.2`; older versions are not claimed supported. Local construction does not establish Marketplace ownership or publishing rights.

All original base values, original exports and the cat sources are hash-guarded against revision `793dcd583c873a7512c6d2a5222d4d0b697f704c`. New aliases and readability overrides exist only in the upgrade. Legacy intentionally retains its previous visual limitations; rollback does not mean it has passed new contrast targets.

## Agent installation and setup quick-start

This guide helps another agent install the theme **only after that workstation's user explicitly authorizes the target app/profile and the requested effect**. This README is not permission to install or activate anything. Installing files and changing an app's selected theme are separate actions.

1. **Use the intended source revision.** Record `git rev-parse HEAD`, inspect its changes and CI, and confirm it is the revision the user asked to install. A pushed feature branch is not automatically merged, released, or suitable for installation; do not silently substitute `master` or another branch.
2. **Inventory and preserve the target.** Identify the exact app, version, profile/config directory and current theme selection. Back up only the files/settings that will be changed, preserve existing Carbonfox and unrelated settings, and use each app's supported install/selection method. Never replace an entire app configuration file or profile.
3. **Follow the matching surface procedure below.** These exports are separate formats; do not copy every file into every application's config directory. No font installation or Hermes source patch is required.
4. **Read back and verify in the real app.** Confirm the installed files and selected theme, inspect the target surface's meaningful visual states, and state which surfaces were and were not verified. Parser, schema, or unit-test results are not live-app acceptance.
5. **Stop safely on a blocked target.** If the exact app/window cannot be inspected safely, leave that surface pending. Do not force input to another window, restart an active app, close user tabs, or claim success from a settings write alone. Roll back by restoring the recorded prior selection and only the files/keys changed.

| Surface | Artifact | Setup instructions |
|---|---|---|
| Hermes CLI / TUI / desktop | `hermes/skins/tokencat.yaml` | [Hermes procedure](#hermes-cli-tui-and-desktop); set `HERMES_HOME` explicitly and use `hermes config set display.skin tokencat`. |
| Hermes dashboard | `hermes/dashboard-themes/tokencat.yaml` | Follow the separate Dashboard procedure below; install independently from the Hermes skin, then select in its picker. |
| Windows Terminal | `windows-terminal/tokencat.scheme.json` | [Windows Terminal procedure](#windows-terminal); merge the scheme by unique name and change only the intended profile's `colorScheme`. |
| VS Code | `vscode/` theme-only extension | [VS Code procedure](#vs-code); with an already available/approved `@vscode/vsce` CLI, run `vsce package` from `vscode/`, install the VSIX with the VS Code CLI, then select **Tokencat**. The contribution also retains **Carbonfox (Legacy)**. |
| WezTerm | `wezterm/tokencat.toml` | [WezTerm procedure](#wezterm); integrate the standalone color scheme into the existing Lua config without replacing it. |
| Zellij | `zellij/tokencat.kdl` | [Zellij procedure](#zellij); install the named theme and validate with the target's native Zellij version before selecting it. |

The detailed steps below include per-surface rollback and known qualification limits. In particular, no native Zellij runtime was available during this bundle's qualification, and Windows Terminal's visual states still require verification on the target installation.

## Safe installation and rollback — only when separately authorized

Source qualification did not itself activate a live theme selection; any downstream deployment is a separate, user-authorized operation. VS Code used separate settings/extension directories, and WezTerm used a separate config/process. VS Code also opened existing app-global shared storage; without a before-image, its integrity or unchanged state cannot be asserted. Captured fingerprint matches establish preservation only for the specifically measured files at the time of comparison, not the entire profile or an ongoing guarantee. A later comparison detected configuration drift; its cause was not established or reversed, and the legacy theme remained selected. Rendered-state evidence is not proof of whole-profile isolation. First qualify the exact app/version and all relevant storage boundaries before a future preview. Back up only the target files/keys, record prior selections, and never replace a whole profile, `config.yaml`, VS Code User Settings, or Windows Terminal `settings.json`. Use artifacts from an explicitly reviewed revision; a branch upload is not a release or proof of full runtime acceptance.

### Hermes CLI, TUI and desktop

1. Explicitly identify the target Hermes home; do not assume `~/.hermes` on Windows or change another profile. Back up any existing `skins/tokencat.yaml`, `skins/carbonfox.yaml`, and the prior `display.skin` value.
2. Copy the two repository skin files into that home's `skins` directory. Keep both names. Do not overwrite an existing customized file without preserving it.
3. After authorization, in a shell with `TARGET_HERMES_HOME` explicitly set, use the supported writer:

```bash
: "${TARGET_HERMES_HOME:?Choose the explicit approved target home first}"
env HERMES_HOME="$TARGET_HERMES_HOME" hermes skin list
env HERMES_HOME="$TARGET_HERMES_HOME" hermes config set display.skin tokencat
env HERMES_HOME="$TARGET_HERMES_HOME" hermes config get display.skin
```

Verify the actual CLI, TUI and desktop independently. Desktop Appearance may have its own selection flow; shared skin parsing alone is not proof that it rendered. Keep the active single-span-per-row token-cat. `banner_logo: " "` is a renderer workaround, not a general hide API; startup artwork may require a restart. Do not enable the alternate two-tone cat until its exact TUI renderer passes the documented gate.

Switch back to the retained Carbonfox selection when desired:

```bash
: "${TARGET_HERMES_HOME:?Choose the explicit approved target home first}"
env HERMES_HOME="$TARGET_HERMES_HOME" hermes config set display.skin carbonfox
env HERMES_HOME="$TARGET_HERMES_HOME" hermes config get display.skin
```

For complete rollback, restore the recorded prior selection (which may not have been Carbonfox) and only the specific overwritten files from the backup. No Hermes source patch or plugin is needed or supplied.

### Dashboard — a separate format and selection

Copy `hermes/dashboard-themes/tokencat.yaml` to the explicitly selected home's `dashboard-themes` directory only after authorization. Refresh and choose **Tokencat** in the dashboard theme picker. Verify `/api/dashboard/themes` and the browser's computed colors: a backend that drops `colorOverrides` or `palette.warmGlow` blocks full-fidelity acceptance. Merely seeing a named theme in the picker is insufficient.

The skin file in `skins/` does not theme the dashboard. Roll back to the exact previous dashboard selection; no legacy Carbonfox dashboard entry is promised. This artifact ships no CSS injection, remote fonts, external assets or dashboard plugin, and does not invent a token-cat slot.

### Windows Terminal

Back up the settings file, then merge both scheme objects into its existing `schemes` array **by unique name**. Do not replace the whole array or create duplicate names. Change only the intended profile's `colorScheme`: `tokencat` for the upgrade, `carbonfox` for legacy. Verify all 16 ANSI colors, truecolor, selection/cursor and glyphs in that profile. For full rollback restore its prior `colorScheme` and only keys changed by the merge. No font change is required.

### VS Code

Use the supplied theme-only extension manifest with fresh user-data/extensions directories. Those directories separate settings and extensions but do not by themselves isolate shared storage or OS integrations; inspect those boundaries before launch and do not claim the entire normal profile is untouched. An Extension Development Host is useful for initial loading; verify ordinary status-bar behavior separately in a normal window with a private passive extension copy and a synthetic folder open. A no-folder window can use different fallback colors. Select **Tokencat**, **Carbonfox (Legacy)**, then **Tokencat**, and verify the actual workbench, syntax, diff, status bar and integrated terminal states.

Alternatively, merge the selected `*-color-customizations.json` fragment into a backed-up settings object. Merge the two named customization objects, preserving unrelated existing keys. Explicit customization keys override a selected theme, so selecting Carbonfox alone will not undo a Tokencat merge: restore the recorded prior values (or remove only keys that did not exist before). Do not replace complete User Settings or assume the generated fragment is a comment-bearing JSONC parser.

### WezTerm

`wezterm/tokencat.toml` is a standalone native color scheme, not a replacement `wezterm.lua`. It includes default text/background, cursor, selection, all 16 ANSI colors, pane separators, scrollbar and tab states. It was parsed and rendered by WezTerm `20240203-110809-5046fc22`; newer versions still require their own validation.

After backing up the relevant existing keys, set `TOKENCAT_SCHEME_FILE` to an explicitly approved copy of this artifact. Integrate only these lines into the existing Lua configuration object, preserving its shell, fonts, keys, domains and other choices:

```lua
local wezterm = require 'wezterm'
local colors = wezterm.color.load_scheme(assert(os.getenv('TOKENCAT_SCHEME_FILE')))
config.color_schemes = config.color_schemes or {}
config.color_schemes.Tokencat = colors
config.color_scheme = 'Tokencat'
```

Do not overwrite an existing customized `Tokencat` scheme without preserving it. For an isolated preview, use the documented `--config-file` and `start --always-new-process --no-auto-connect` options with a task-owned config; a new window alone does not prevent loading the real config. Restore only the prior `color_scheme` and the scheme entry changed by this integration for rollback. No shell/font/keybinding changes are shipped.

### Zellij

`zellij/tokencat.kdl` targets the modern role schema shipped in **Zellij v0.45.1**: text, ribbons, tables, lists, frames, exit statuses and all ten multiplayer colors. It themes Zellij's UI; pane/application ANSI colors still belong to the hosting terminal. It does not ship a session layout, keybindings or plugins.

Copy the file into the explicitly selected Zellij configuration directory's `themes` subdirectory, preserving any existing file. In a backed-up configuration, select `theme "tokencat"`. Validate with the real target Zellij version in an isolated configuration/session first; no native Zellij executable was available during this qualification. The repository reader validates only the emitted nested-block/RGB subset and palette mappings, not all KDL or native rendering. Restore the recorded prior theme and only the copied file for rollback.

## Artwork, optional fonts and scope

Both skins share the unchanged 29×11 token-cat from [ascii-art](ascii-art/README.md). The owner reports verbal permission to use/modify Hayley Jane Wakenshaw's artwork; see [NOTICE](NOTICE.md). An Internet archive is not a blanket redistribution license.

`fonts/install-hack-nerd-font.sh` remains optional and unchanged. It targets Nerd Fonts `v3.5.1`, verifies its pinned digest before extraction, and installs only Mono TTFs. Do not run it merely to use the palette. If registry registration fails, copied fonts remain and require deliberate recovery. The test suite uses temporary supplied ZIPs and a fail-closed fake-`reg` guard; it never invokes real registration or downloads fonts.

The named Hermes surfaces, VS Code, Windows Terminal, WezTerm and Zellij have dedicated artifacts or the shared native skin listed above. Neovim and arbitrary other apps are not claimed supported; no whole-workstation configuration is shipped. The retired gist [`16349ada05bdf04399aa328fd0231184`](https://gist.github.com/16349ada05bdf04399aa328fd0231184) is historical, not a current artifact or settings migration.

## Rights

No blanket license is granted for original repository material. Upstream-derived Nightfox material retains its [complete MIT notice](licenses/nightfox-MIT.txt). The local VS Code package remains `UNLICENSED`; no font binaries are vendored. See [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md) for the unchanged artwork permission boundary.
